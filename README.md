# Feature-Fusion-Based-Face-Image-Retrieval
An image processing system for use in forensic science that retrieves the face of the object (victim/offender) according to the sketches provided by extracting GLCM, HOG, and GW features. Matching was first performed by extracting these features using k-NN and re-matching was again performed by extracting S-DoGOGH and D-DoGOGH features to establish the validity of the matching process. This system was proposed by Setumin et al and an investigation was carried out to study the validity of the system for matching victims of acid attacks, fire burns, and freak accidents, and the extent to which forensic reconstruction was required for a given object. 

It was established that the model was efficient in standing its ground over distortions introduced, allowing retrieval of potential mugshots for victims with disfigurations within 60% and requiring sketch-based forensic reconstruction for victims with disfigurations over 60%. The model was found to be significantly suitable for identifying a Jane Doe or a John Doe buried over several years after being subjected to forensic reconstruction with minimum inaccuracies. 

The dataset used was the CUFS database.
